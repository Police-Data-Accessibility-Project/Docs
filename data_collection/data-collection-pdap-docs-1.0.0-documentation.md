# FOIA Requests

### What are FOIA requests?

[The Freedom of Information Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_%28United_States%29) \(FOIA, pronounced FOYA\) has created the springboard for citizens to request data from any level of government. Not all documentation can be disclosed with the public, but FOIA Requests are the place to start.

### Can I help by making requests?

Yes, but not exactly. Skills developed while making FOIA requests \(curiosity, persistence, etc\), are very helpful in collecting data and building a dataset catalogue. Start here: [Collect public police data]().

We aren’t currently prioritizing FOIA requests because of the data that’s already publicly accessible.

#### But I have data!

If you’ve made requests and have some data, [you can submit it here](https://forms.gle/RG3K4WjVtvKMjxHi7).
