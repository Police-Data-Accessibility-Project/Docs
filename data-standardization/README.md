# Data Standardization

We're currently translating data from our [Scrapers]() to a unified format in [Dolt](../data-storage/dolthub.md). We're translating the data at the point of collection.

## Requirements

### Do I need to know how to write an ETL?

No, but someone will need to add one for us to use your data. If you need help, reach out in the \#scrapers slack channel.

### What are we translating to?

A unified format for each [data\_type](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/data/master/data_types).
