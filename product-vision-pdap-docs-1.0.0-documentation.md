### PDAP aims to be a **Source of Truth** for police data.[¶](product-vision-pdap-docs-1.0.0-documentation.md#pdap-aims-to-be-a-source-of-truth-for-police-data)

There are about 18,000 police organizations, and each has a unique way to make data public. This means that, effectively, **the data is not public**. We can make it public by consolidating it. We speculate that the key audience is **data scientists and journalists**. They do the analysis, and are the critical channel for information to flow from police organizations to policymakers and the general public.

_We become more effective as we scale each of these services:_ **Collection** → **Storage** → **Standardization** → **Access** \(→ **Analysis**\)

**Collection** is the group of automated and manual processes that legally gather police data.

1. Automated data scrapers regularly consolidate public police information.
2. Humans operate semi-automated processes to gather public information.
3. Facilitate data sharing by good-faith police organizations.

**Storage** must be archival, verifiable, and secure. There are three distinct types.

1. A Holding Ground where data can be dropped, where it is checked for integrity and security.
2. A Gold Standard, the unified archive that we manage.
3. A public-facing portal that’s as accessible and standardized as possible.

**Standardization** normalizes information into a unified format. This facilitates analysis and access at a larger scale.

**Access** means hosting data for citizens and data scientists. This is anything between a direct download and API web hooks.
