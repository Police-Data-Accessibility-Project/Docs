Indiana Court Data can be found [here](https://public.courts.in.gov/home/portal), however their Terms of Service state if you are wanting Bulk Data then you must go [this route](https://www.in.gov/courts/iocs/statistics/bulk-data/), fill out some forms and it appears there is a cost to get the data

# Data refresh rate
More high volume / main city departments like Carmel or IMPD update more frequently (almost daily) than the rural departments, such as Greensburg (updates at the end of the year).

# Sample response
In `USA/IN/marion/data`

# Legal
Is there anything specific to this jurisdiction we should know as we work?
 - State court data needs to go through the proper [Bulk Data form](https://www.in.gov/courts/iocs/statistics/bulk-data/)

# Data uniformity
Are cases or records numbered in a consistent (or inconsistent) way that might be helpful to note?
 - Indiana Court Data does have a format outlined [here](https://www.in.gov/courts/rules/admin/index.html#_Toc60037232)
