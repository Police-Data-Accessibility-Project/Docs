# How to locate the data source
On the [main page](https://www.citruscollege.edu/campussafety/Pages/default.aspx), under `Clery Act`, all data available can be found.

# Data refresh rate
All data is currently a year behind, leading me to believe that it is updated at the end of the year.

# Sample response
In `USA/CA/citrus_college/data`

# Legal
Is there anything specific to this jurisdiction we should know as we work?

# Data uniformity
Are cases or records numbered in a consistent (or inconsistent) way that might be helpful to note?
