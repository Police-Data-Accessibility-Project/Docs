# How to locate the data source
Go to https://www.antiochca.gov/police/
Right side > Crime statistics > crime statistics


Eventually a scraper will be written for the [arrest reports](https://www.antiochca.gov/police/crime-statistics/adult-arrest-report/)


# Data refresh rate
Crime stats are yearly, with the exception of the current year, which I believe updates monthly


[Calls for service](https://www.antiochca.gov/police/crime-statistics/calls-for-service/) (**Not Scraped**) updates weekly.


[Adult arrest reports](https://www.antiochca.gov/police/crime-statistics/adult-arrest-report/) (**Not Scraped**) updates weekly (Pull on Monday)
