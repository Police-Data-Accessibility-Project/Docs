`/list_pdf_extractors/` Is where the most recent list_pdf_extractors can be found. They use imported scripts with low-customizability, which can be found in `/common/list_pdf_scrapers/`.

If you need to have more control over the scraper, use the scripts located within `template`. These are the full scrapers, with fewer imported functions, allowing greater customization of them.
