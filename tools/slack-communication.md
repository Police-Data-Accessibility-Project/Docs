# Slack - Communication

## Introduction

You can join our [Slack here](https://join.slack.com/t/policeaccessibility/shared_invite/zt-ial0bvnm-D_T7R6za4aKh1f9jGUM0pg). By default, you will join the following channels:

* `#_announcements`
* `#_general`
* `#_introduceyourself`
* `#_requests`

After introducing yourself in `#_introduceyourself`, head to the channel browser to add yourself to more channels that may line up with your level of expertise!

#### Desktop

 [![Option 1: Click the + icon and the Browse Channels](https://pdap-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/slack_desktop_browse_channels.png)](https://pdap-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/slack_desktop_browse_channels.png)
