| Agency                 | A police department or organization, like "Aurora Police Department".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [Dataset](datasets/)   | A URL pointing to a place on a police website where public records may be scraped, like "police-agency.com/arrest-reports". Each Dataset needs a Scraper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Scraper / Data Scraper | <p>A bit of Python code responsible for collecting public records from an agency website within our <a href="../meta/legal/legal-data-scraping.md">legal requirements</a>. Some of the code is "common," shared between Scrapers. The starting point for information about Scrapers is <a href="https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/">the GitHub repo</a>.</p><p></p><p><em>Colloquially, "scraper" may refer to a person writing a Scraper.</em></p> |
| Extraction             | The result of running a Scraper is an Extraction, which represents all the records found at a given Dataset at the time the Scraper was run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Extraction Metadata    | Packaged with each Extraction is metadata with information about when the Extraction was made, from which Dataset, and using which Scraper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Data Integrity         | By observing the requirements for [Data Intake](data-intake.md), we can be sure that every record has an auditable history and passes the "bright-line" test for tracing data back to its origin. This is how we prove we aren't inventing dataâ€”we're surfacing what's already public, and we can prove it.                                                                                                                                                                          |
