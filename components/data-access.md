# Data Access

## Purpose

Host data for citizens and data scientists, from direct downloads to API web hooks.

## Current State

Aggregated public police data is [collected here](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/data-intake). Read more about [how we use DoltHub here](../tools/dolthub.md).

## Future State

A front end data portal and export tool hosted on our website.   
  
We are looking to use Django for the front-end because we're so python-dense.
