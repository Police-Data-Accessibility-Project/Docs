# Data Storage

## Purpose

Archival, verifiable, and secure data storage is the core of our mission.

* A Holding Ground where data can be dropped by the public, and is then checked for integrity and security.
* A "Gold Standard", the unified archive we manage and the primary source for data consumers.
* A public-facing data access point that's as accessible and uniform as possible.

## Current state

We don't yet have much data in permanent storage, so [Dolt](../tools/dolthub.md) fulfills our requirements until we outgrow it or need more than it offers in some critical area.

## Future state
