# Data Intake

## Requirements

1. We know when data was submitted.
2. We know which scraper was used to generate the data.
3. _Nice-to-have: we know who submitted the data._

Since we have git version control on our scrapers, we can audit any piece of submitted data to understand how it was gathered.

## Current Process

This is a work in progress. [Here's the GitHub issue](https://github.com/police-data-accessibility-project/pdap-scrapers/issues/80).
