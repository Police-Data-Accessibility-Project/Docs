# Data Intake

## Current process

Instructions for running scrapers can be found [in the Scrapers repo](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/blob/main/README.md).

Submission is a work in progress. [Here's the GitHub issue](https://github.com/police-data-accessibility-project/pdap-scrapers/issues/80). For now, reach out in Discord.

## Requirements

1. We know when data was submitted.
2. We know which scraper was used to generate the data.
3. _Nice-to-have: we know who submitted the data._

Since we have git version control on our scrapers, we can audit any piece of submitted data to understand how it was gathered.
