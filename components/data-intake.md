# Data Intake

## Current status

We're still in the iteration and case study phase. To submit data:&#x20;

1. Run an approved Scraper from the [Scrapers Repo](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers) to get an Extraction.
2. Share your Extraction in Discord. We'll work with you to write and publish a case study.
3. We'll work with data consumers to understand how we're doing.
4. When we have learned from case studies, we'll solidify the process.

## Requirements

1. We know when data was submitted.
2. We know which scraper was used to generate the data.
3. _Nice-to-have: we know who submitted the data._

Since we have git version control on our scrapers, we can audit any piece of submitted data to understand how it was gathered.
