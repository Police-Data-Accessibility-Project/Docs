# Validate Datasets PRs

DoltHub is where data PRs are submitted. Pull Requests are made to the Datasets repo by the community here: [https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/pulls](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/pulls)

1. If you haven't used DoltHub before, start with [this setup doc](../../../../tools/dolthub.md).
2. Find a DoltHub PR to download. If you don't know where to start, ask in the DoltHub Discord in the \#data-bounties channel.
3. Use the [Datasets Submission Checker scripts](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-app/blob/main/utilities/Datasets%20Submission%20Checker/README.md) on the data in the Pull Request, and post your results as a comment! The submitter will either improve their submission or remove the problematic rows.
