# Key Scraping Principles

## Requirements

* We always need to know **when** data was submitted.
* We need to know **which code** was used to scrape the data.
* We need to know from **which source** the data was collected.

This means we have an open-source library of Scrapers, and each Data Extraction is stored with metadata telling the story of how it was created.
