# PDAP Community Onboarding

There are two major places to contribute: **data collection & processing** and **coding to automate those two things**.

### How to get involved:

1. Find a task!
   * [Write a data scraper](data_collection/write-a-data-scraper.md)
   * [Work an open Volunteer Task](https://pdap.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10016)
   * [Work an open Infrastructure issue](https://pdap.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10014)
   * [Work an open SQL database issue](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/issues)
2. Optionally but encouraged, complete the [Intake Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13HiD4CNTq8DOlwQtbIw2CfSjjDlveBpwxr7LRtcKeIo/edit?usp=sharing) so we know what you plan to work on.
3. Head to **\#volunteer-start** in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/policeaccessibility/shared_invite/zt-ial0bvnm-D_T7R6za4aKh1f9jGUM0pg) to say hello. Slack is where you can ask questions related to what youâ€™re working on, make suggestions, and join the PDAP community.
