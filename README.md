# Welcome to PDAP!

If you don't know what this is, start at [https://pdap.io/](https://pdap.io/).

## How to get involved

### Collect Data

**Get paid to collect data** as [part of a Data Bounty](components/data-collection/data-bounties.md). None are currently active, but we need [contributions to datasets](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/doc/master). You can help build a database of police agencies for a community of data collectors!

New to python? You can help check any submissions to our datasets pending approval. If there are data submissions pending, you can [run these utilities to check incoming data](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-app/blob/main/utilities/Datasets%20Submission%20Checker/README.md). Accelerate the data intake process! If you have questions, reach out in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cn2ZpVTdw7)!

### Contribute Code

Know python? [Contribute to our **Data Scrapers repo**](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

[Head to the GitHub Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/17) to work on infrastructure issues.

### Donate to PDAP

**Donate on** [**PayPal**](https://www.paypal.com/biz/fund?id=SLS5DB8SMDC3G) **or** [**Patreon**](https://patreon.com/pdap)**,** and we'll spend it on [Data Bounties](https://docs.pdap.io/updates/blog/may-2021-dolt-bounty) and infrastructure improvements. Small recurring donations are most helpful. Stability helps us chart a path.
