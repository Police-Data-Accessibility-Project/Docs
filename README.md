# Welcome to PDAP!

There are two major places to contribute: **data collection & processing** and **coding to automate those two things.**

### How to get involved:

1. Decide how you'd like to contribute:
   * [Write a data scraper](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/Scrapers/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
   * [Work an open Volunteer Task](https://pdap.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10016)
   * [Work an open Infrastructure issue](https://pdap.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10014)
2. Head to **\#introduce-yourself** in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/policeaccessibility/shared_invite/zt-ial0bvnm-D_T7R6za4aKh1f9jGUM0pg) to say hello. Slack is where you can ask questions related to what youâ€™re working on, make suggestions, and join the PDAP community.
