# Welcome to PDAP!

There are two major places to contribute: **data collection & processing** and **coding to automate those two things.**

### How to get involved:

1. Decide how you'd like to contribute:
   * [Participate in a paid Data Bounty](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/bounties/3c259649-762e-438b-a538-b14be4d0507a)

2. Head to **\#new-members** in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/cn2ZpVTdw7) to say hello. Discord is where you can ask questions related to what youâ€™re working on, make suggestions, and join the PDAP community.
