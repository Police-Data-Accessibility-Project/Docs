# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to PDAP!

Read more about our mission at [https://pdap.io/](https://pdap.io).

## What is PDAP?

PDAP is a non-profit making open-source code to achieve our mission: consolidating data from every U.S. agency into a **single public resource.**

### Our core work

We're building a small suite of tools to help contributors do these things:

1. Track [police datasets](activities/submit-or-update-datasets/what-are-datasets.md), our "to do list" of websites with data to collect.
2. Submit [data scrapers to our repo](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers).
3. Run scrapers and [submit the extractions](components/data-intake.md) to our database.

## How do we work?

We're a rotating cast of volunteers with a flat organizational structure. The core PDAP staff keep the lights on and allow our community to move the mission forward, step by step.

We're a learning organization, and **we want to hear from you.** If you have questions, concerns, suggestions, or expertise, reach out in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cn2ZpVTdw7) or to [operations@pdap.io](mailto:operations@pdap.io).
