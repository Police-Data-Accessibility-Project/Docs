# Welcome to PDAP!

Read more about our mission at [https://pdap.io/](https://pdap.io/).

## How do we work?

We're a rotating cast of volunteers with a flat organizational structure. Our goal is to collect public police data, and there's a lot of it. If you're reading this, there is still work to do.

We're a learning organization, and **we want to hear from you.** If you have questions, concerns, suggestions, or expertise, reach out in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cn2ZpVTdw7).

* Python coders of any experience level to [write data scrapers](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Non-code volunteering

* Grant writing and non-profit operations experts to help us secure funding.

### Donate

**Donate on** [**PayPal**](https://www.paypal.com/biz/fund?id=SLS5DB8SMDC3G) **or** [**Patreon**](https://patreon.com/pdap)**,** and we'll spend it on [Data Bounties](https://docs.pdap.io/updates/blog/may-2021-dolt-bounty) and infrastructure improvements. Small recurring donations are most helpful. Stability helps us chart a path.
