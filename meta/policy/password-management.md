# Password Management

#### What’s the policy?

The following must be true for new services: 1. Eddie Brown has admin or owner access. 2. At least 3 people from the PDAP team have admin or owner access, to the extent it’s possible. “Admin or owner access” confers the ability to manage users/members, and billing.
