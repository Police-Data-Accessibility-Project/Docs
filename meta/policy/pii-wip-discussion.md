# PII \(WIP / Discussion\)

## Problem

We want people to feel sound ethically and legally when they contribute to PDAP. To that end, we need to do these things: 

1. Draw a “bright line” between the source material and the published data; i.e. “we are not changing the data, we are a mirror”. **\[a\]** 
2. Avoid aggregating already-public PII in a way that would make it more public than it already is **\[b\]**.
3. Strive for our stated mission **\[c\]** of being a complete source of truth. i.e. “we could not be accused of editorializing by omission”. Our current policy is that we're allowed to collect PII **\[d\]** . 

Our existing policy about _accepting_ PII is legally the right one but we do need to discuss how we _aggregate_ and _omit_. Discuss in the thread for the next 3 days, then we'll do a survey or something.

## Ideas

* No commercial use
* Don't make PII searchable
  * Don't put it in DoltHub
  * Don't extract it from the source at all, leave it in the PDF
