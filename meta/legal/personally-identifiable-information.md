# Personally Identifiable Information

## Resolution on PII policy

In short: yes, you can submit PII from all **government-provided data.**

### Excerpts

> RESOLVED, that the Corporation supports the collection, storage, and making accessible of ALL government-provided, public, and legally available law enforcement data, **including PII**

> RESOLVED, that any **edits** made by the Corporation to the data will be for **formatting purposes** only to facilitate accessibility

## Rationale

Our mission is to aggregate public police data as faithfully as possible. Only already-public data is in our scope. Once we edit the data, we can no longer draw the required "[bright line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright-line_rule)" to the public source material.

### Reference:

#### [2 CFR ยง 200.79](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/2/200.79)

> Some information that is considered to be [PII](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=36f2ad20a9f9dcfe3e6a38444824d887&term_occur=999&term_src=Title:2:Subtitle:A:Chapter:II:Part:200:Subpart:A:Subjgrp:27:200.79) is available in public sources such as telephone books, public Web sites, and university listings. This type of information is considered to be Public [PII](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=36f2ad20a9f9dcfe3e6a38444824d887&term_occur=999&term_src=Title:2:Subtitle:A:Chapter:II:Part:200:Subpart:A:Subjgrp:27:200.79)...

This definition of public data is also supported in [HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn#cite_note-1).
