# Product Vision

## PDAP aims to be a **Source of Truth** for police data.

There are about 18,000 police organizations, and each has a unique way to make data public. This means that, effectively, **the data is not public**. We can make it public by consolidating it. We speculate that the key audience is **data scientists and journalists**. They do the analysis, and are the critical channel for information to flow from police organizations to policymakers and the general public.

## Where are we now?

> Welcome to the early days.

We submitted our Form 1023 to the IRS in January. It takes 6–12 months to get official nonprofit status. We came into being as an entity \(Delaware C-corp\) in December and our first 990 \(all zeros\) will be filed in the coming weeks by the registered agent we hired in Delaware. Our PayPal is up and we are have gotten enough donations to cover start up costs and a few licenses for basic infrastructure tools like Jira and hosting.

### Isn't the scope of this project too big?

We've been hearing that since the very first day, and decided to try anyway.

Since [late May 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/gr11aw/i_think_i_accidentally_started_a_movement), our volunteer base in Slack peaked and declined. After some iteration, a core group of ~10 active members has been keeping the project moving slowly and steadily.

Right now our focus is on lowering barriers for volunteers to get involved at scale again, with a public home for the data that's being collected.

## How are we planning to grow?

_We become more effective as we scale each of these services:_ **Collection** → **Storage** → **Standardization** → **Access** \(→ **Analysis**\)

\*\*\*\*[**Collection**](../../components/data-collection/) is the group of automated and manual processes that legally gather police data.

1. Automated data scrapers regularly consolidate public police information.
2. Humans operate semi-automated processes to gather public information.
3. Facilitate data sharing by good-faith police organizations.

\*\*\*\*[**Storage**](../../components/data-storage.md) must be archival, verifiable, and secure. There are three distinct types.

1. A Holding Ground where data can be dropped, where it is checked for integrity and security.
2. A Gold Standard, the unified archive that we manage.
3. A public-facing portal that’s as accessible and standardized as possible.

\*\*\*\*[**Standardization**](../../components/data-standardization/) normalizes information into a unified format. This facilitates analysis and access at a larger scale.

\*\*\*\*[**Access**](../../components/data-access.md) means hosting data for citizens and data scientists. This is anything between a direct download and API web hooks.
