# Writing about PDAP

## Goals

### Be a source of truth.

Our reputation for accuracy and integrity must be unimpeachable. If you can't say something with certainty—say less!

### Have maintainable, future-proof messaging.

When something changes, it can be a pain—or impossible—to update links all over the place. If you're **filling out a profile,** link to language on [https://pdap.io](http://pdap.io/). If you'd like to tell people **where to contribute,** link to [https://pdap.io/contribute.html](https://pdap.io/contribute.html). Those links will always take people to the right place.
