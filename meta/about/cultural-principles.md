# Cultural Principles

## Why data is powerful

> We can't fix what we can't measure. Accessibility leads to accountability.

## Which data we're after

> Each of us has a different vision for the future of law enforcement, but the first step is understanding the current state of policing.

Depth first. By performing a narrow service exceptionally well, we can start a chain reaction of positive impact. Our goal should be complete, organized accounting of a local police ecosystem.

## Who we serve

People who want to submit public police data.

Consumers of public police data: all of us.

## How we operate

> We are a learning organization: we do not dictate; we solve problems systematically; we encourage individual experimentation and autonomy; we document our efforts; we listen to new voices; we share our knowledge.

> Individuals can use information to make a positive impact on their community through direct action. This organizing is the foundation for government policy.

Recurring small contributions are the best way to capture early-stage public enthusiasm and cultivate long term support.

Why live without when we could build it? Why build it when we could just buy it? Why buy it when it's free and good enough?

## How we're perceived

We are open in our goals, methods, progress, failures, and results.

The most critical element of our project is trust that we are faithfully producing the data that exists. Failure comes when we police think we're hackers or data scientists think we have bad practices.

We make the case by demonstrating success. How much data did we acquire? What resources did we need to do it? How does this impact our next steps?

## What we need

> Donate your time; donate your money; share our work with people you know; use our data.
