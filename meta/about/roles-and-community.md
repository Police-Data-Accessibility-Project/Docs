# Roles & Community

## Goals

We are building a platform which serves two broad groups.

1. **Data collectors.** They may be volunteering their time, and may be paid by PDAP or someone else to target specific data. PDAP serves them by providing a platform to run data scrapers, a home for the data, and a community of people on the same mission.
2. **Data consumers.** This is anyone who wants to access the data collected by the volunteer community.

Discord is our primary active community, and where all current roles are delineated. [Join us in Discord here](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ).

## Board

As an open source nonprofit, our leadership is there to make sure the lights are on and that blockers to forward progress are lifted. [Read more here](staff/).

## Team

Directors are appointed by the board to serve in consistent, active roles to facilitate the work of the volunteer community and access to data by everyone.&#x20;

A handful of leading contributors are nominated to the `PDAP team` role in Discord, making them sources of information & decisions if needed.
