# PDAP A-1: Collect public police data

## Overview[¶](collect-public-police-data-pdap-docs-1.0.0-documentation.md#overview)

Search for the public records of an appropriate jurisdiction and submit it to us.

### Step 1. Pick a jurisdiction.[¶](collect-public-police-data-pdap-docs-1.0.0-documentation.md#step-1-pick-a-jurisdiction)

One you care about, one you live in, or one you know has interesting public records. Before you put time into collection, check the [Dataset Catalog](https://pdap-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_collection/data_sources/catalog.html) and [already captured data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rOxMSSMQvWTdT-bdS6iG6c9cJQ7MsSpF) to make sure it hasn’t been grabbed recently.

### Step 2. Locate the data source.[¶](collect-public-police-data-pdap-docs-1.0.0-documentation.md#step-2-locate-the-data-source)

Find where the data is kept, and [submit it to the form here](https://forms.gle/JymurSzN1Nf2ZUbq7). We’ll add it to the [Dataset Catalog](https://pdap-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_collection/data_sources/catalog.html)!

### Step 3. Submit data to PDAP[¶](collect-public-police-data-pdap-docs-1.0.0-documentation.md#step-3-submit-data-to-pdap)

#### Process the data.[¶](collect-public-police-data-pdap-docs-1.0.0-documentation.md#process-the-data)

Do as much as you can to turn the data from the starting format \(often PDF\) to something closer to Excel, CSV or JSON format. If you can’t do any of that—no sweat! We have other experts for processing the data you collect.

#### Compile the data.[¶](collect-public-police-data-pdap-docs-1.0.0-documentation.md#compile-the-data)

Convert it into a .zip file. If you have processed the data, include both the original data, anything you used to do conversion, and the cleaned up submission material.

#### Send it to us![¶](collect-public-police-data-pdap-docs-1.0.0-documentation.md#send-it-to-us)

Create a Keybase account and submit it to the [Keybase Intake form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wVxuP7n-yqDQ-LKiQWj0uABh7exlLNOl1r7WYz-CiXY/edit). This should take 5 minutes, and helps us keep track of who’s submitting data! Use the [data upload form here](https://forms.gle/RG3K4WjVtvKMjxHi7) to send your data. If you have any questions, refer to \#volunteer-data in Slack.
