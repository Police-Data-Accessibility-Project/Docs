# Data Intake app

`$25k`

## Why we need this

Allowing data collection activists to submit scrapers is a critical piece of the PDAP mission. It empowers data scraping volunteers with any experience level to make impactful contributions. It allows us to audit submitted data by documenting which Scraper was used, and when.

## What we need

### Resources required

* A senior Python developer for an estimated 320 hours of work. This is a small app, but an 8-week engagement gives us time to test and refine multiple concepts, as well as deploy it and make a plan for further versions of the app.

### App requirements

* [https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/issues/80](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/issues/80)
* Scraper developers have the ability to configure their Scrapers to work with the PDAP Data Intake app.
* When properly configured Scrapers are run, they generate [Extractions and Metadata](https://docs.pdap.io/components/writing-about-pdap) which are sent to a PDAP intake server.
