# Datasets Management app

`$5k`

## Why we need this

Our database of police Datasets functions as a community to-do list of police websites to scrape for data. Its status is directly related to the health of the PDAP data ecosystem. Updating this database is a primary focus of the community. This app is designed to make that work as efficient as possible, allowing us to do more with less.

## What we need

### Resources required

* A senior Python developer familiar with Django for an estimated 80 hours of work. We have an existing app, so a 2-week engagement gives us the time we need to polish the existing tool.

### App requirements

* People maintaining our Datasets can use a simple web form to enter information about new or existing Datasets one by one. [GitHub issue here](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Datasets-App/issues/31).
* People using our Datasets can use a simple UI to find Datasets based on search criteria. [GitHub issue here](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Datasets-App/issues/1).
