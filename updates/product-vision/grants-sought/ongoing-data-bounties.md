# Ongoing data bounties

`$flexible`

## Why we need this

We rely on volunteers to scale our Datasets database, but [Data Bounties](../../../activities/data-collection/data-bounties.md) can accelerate that effort.

Datasets are a tool for data scrapers. Additionally, rapidly growing the Datasets database with a particular focus is a way for us to learn more about police data landscape and plan our efforts accordingly.

## What we need

Anywhere from $100 to $10,000 or more to run small experiments and identify which bounty strategies are effective. Larger bounties can be applied when we know what works.

### Example bounties

#### Experimental / learning focused

* controlled experiments for different regions
* controlled experiments for different data types

#### Growth focused

* raw dataset quantities
* types of records, like bulletins
* types of datasets, like bulletins
* sitemaps
