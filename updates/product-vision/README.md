# Current Progress

## Where are we now?

For an up to the moment answer, you can [look to our Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/17).

> Welcome to the early days.

We're a 501c3 non-profit corporation as of August 15, 2021. We came into being as an entity \(Delaware C-corp\) in December 2020. We have enough donations to keep the lights on.

Right now our focus is on documenting an end-to-end proof of concept of our vision for for a small geographic area.

### Isn't the scope of this project too big?

We've been hearing that since the very first day, and decided to try anyway.

Since [late May 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/gr11aw/i_think_i_accidentally_started_a_movement), our online population peaked and declined. After some iteration, a core group of 4â€“8 long term members has been keeping the project moving with the contributions of a rotating talent pool of volunteers.

## How are we planning to grow?

> We become more effective as we scale each of these services.

[**Collection**](../../activities/data-collection/) is the group of automated and manual processes that legally gather police data.

\*\*\*\*[**Storage**](../../components/data-storage/) must be archival, verifiable, and secure.

\*\*\*\*[**Standardization**](../../components/data-standardization/) normalizes information into a unified format for access at scale.

\*\*\*\*[**Access**](../../components/data-access.md) is anything between a direct download and API web hooks.
