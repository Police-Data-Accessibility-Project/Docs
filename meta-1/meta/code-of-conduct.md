# Code of Conduct

This policy is directly adapted from Wikipedia's [Universal Code of Conduct](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Universal_Code_of_Conduct).

## Context

We believe in empowering as many people as possible to actively participate in PDAP.

All who participate in this community will:

* Share institutional knowledge.
* Avoid bias and prejudice.
* Work towards accuracy and verifiability in all its work.

This code applies to everyone who interacts and contributes to online and offline PDAP projects and spaces.

If you'd like to make a proposal, view this page in GitHub and make a pull request.

## Expected behavior

Every PDAP community member is responsible for their own behavior.Our spaces are founded in respect, civility, collegiality, solidarity and good citizenship.

### Mutual respect

**Practice empathy.** Listen to people from different backgrounds, and try to understand their point of view.

**Assume the good will of others** unless proven otherwise.Provide and receive feedback kindly. Criticism should be delivered in a sensitive and constructive manner.

**Respect the way that people describe themselves.** As a sign of respect, use these terms when communicating with or about these people wherever possible. For examples:

* Ethnic groups may use a specific name to describe themselves, rather than the name historically used by others;
* People may have names that use letters, sounds, or words from their language which may be unfamiliar to you;
* People who identify with a certain sexual orientation or gender identity using distinct names or pronouns;
* People having a particular physical or mental disability may use particular terms to describe themselves
* During in-person meetings, we will be welcoming to everyone and we will be mindful and respectful of each othersâ€™ preferences, boundaries, sensibilities, traditions and requirements.

### Be nice to each other.

**Mutual support** and **good citizenship** means taking active responsibility for ensuring that the Wikimedia projects are productive, pleasant and safe spaces, and contribute to the Wikimedia mission.

**Mentorship:** Helping newcomers to find their way and acquire essential skills.

**Look out:** Lend other volunteers a hand when they need support, and speak up for them when they are treated in a way that falls short of this code.

**Recognize others:** Thank people for their help and work. Give credit where it is due.

## Unacceptable behavior

### Harassment

Behavior can be considered harassment if it is beyond what a reasonable person would be expected to tolerate in a global, intercultural environment. In some cases, behavior that would not rise to the level of harassment in a single case can become harassment through repetition. 

Harassment includes but is not limited to:

* **Insults:** This includes name calling, using slurs or stereotypes, and any attacks based on personal characteristics. In some cases, repeated mockery, sarcasm, or aggression constitute insults collectively.
* **Sexual harassment:** Sexual attention or advances toward others where it is unwelcome or where consent cannot be communicated.
* **Threats:** Explicitly or implicitly suggesting the possibility of physical violence, unfair embarrassment, harm to reputation, or legal intimidation as a way to change someone's behavior.
* **Encouraging harm:** Self-harm or harm to a third party.
* **Disclosure of personal data:** sharing other contributors' private information without consent.
* **Hounding:** following a person across the project\(s\) and repeatedly critiquing their work with the intent to upset or discourage them.
* **Trolling:** Deliberately disrupting conversations or posting in bad-faith to provoke.

### Abuse of power, privilege, or influence

Abuse occurs when someone in a real or perceived position of power, privilege, or influence engages in disrespectful, cruel, and/or violent behavior toward other people.

Examples include:

**Abuse of office by functionaries, officials and staff** to intimidate or threaten others.

**Abuse of seniority and connections** to intimidate or threaten others. Take special care of your position and how it can affect others.

**Psychological manipulation** to cause someone to doubt their senses to change their behavior.

### Data vandalism

Deliberately introducing false, incomplete, inaccurate or inappropriate data, or disrupting the creation or maintenance of a data source.
